This is a couple of updates to [[https://github.com/Archenoth/dotemacs][my main dotemacs repo]], mostly for visual updates that assume you have compiled Emacs with [[https://github.com/wachikun/emacs_bgex][Emacs bgex]].

[[./Crinkly-config.png]]

To do this, I recommend:

1) Cloning [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs][this emacs mirror]]
2) Checking out the latest release tag that has a patch in the [[https://github.com/wachikun/emacs_bgex][Emacs bgex]] repo
3) Downloading said patch and applying it with =patch -p1 < patch-bgex_<The release>=
4) Compiling emacs and =sudo make install=-ing it
5) Following the instructions on [[https://github.com/Archenoth/dotemacs][my main config]]
6) Clone this repo into =.emacs.d= with =git clone https://github.com/Archenoth/dotemacs.git ~/.emacs.d/Crinkly-config=
7) Put [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wachikun/emacs_bgex/master/bgex.el][bgex.el]] into the same folder as this file
8) Add the following code block to your =.emacs= (You can tangle it too if you're cool with it being overwritten)

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle ~/.emacs :padline no
  (require 'ob-tangle)
  (org-babel-load-file "~/.emacs.d/dotemacs/Archenoth-config.org")
  (org-babel-load-file "~/.emacs.d/Crinkly-config/Crinkly-config.org")
#+END_SRC

Included with this repo is a AyaseHex.xpm file made for 1366x768 screens, and a AyaseHex.xcf file to let you make bigger ones! (Up to 1080p)
